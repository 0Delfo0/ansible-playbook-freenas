# FreeNAS Playbook

This is a work in progress. It covers some basic settings to make sure a FreeNAS install can send you alerts and is monitoring your disk drives properly. It uses the FreeNAS REST API extensively.

This will eventually be converted into a role and also a module to clean up the API calls into something more friendly for Ansible.
